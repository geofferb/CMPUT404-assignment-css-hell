HTML changes
============
To apply CSS to each HTML ebook, the following line was added to each file.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css" />
```
Since both book 2 and 3 store their cover as `cover.jpg`, book 2's cover was renamed to `cover2.jpg`, and its reference in `2.html` was changed accordingly.
